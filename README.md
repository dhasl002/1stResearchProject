# Matching Secondary Structures in Cryo-EM

While more atomic structures are being solved using Cryo-EM, it is still challenging to derive atomic structures from density maps produced at medium resolution when no suitable templates are available. A critical step in structure determination is how a protein chain threads through the 3-dimensional density map. A hueristic method was developed to generate K best matches of secondary structures between the density map and its protein sequence using shortest paths in a related weighted graph.
